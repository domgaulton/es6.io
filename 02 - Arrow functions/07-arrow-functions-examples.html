// Example - The supplied data is poor and not structured well! Ideally want it in an object to crack on!
const race = '100m Dash';
const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

// // Using ({curly brackets}) we can return an object from the function
// const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({
// 	name: winner,
// 	race: race, 
//   place: i + 1
// 	})
// );

// Instead of using race: race where object name is the same as object value you can just use single race parameter
const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));
console.table(win);

const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

// Filter only the ages at are over 60 and make new array called old
const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
console.log(old);
