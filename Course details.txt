What Will I Learn?

The goal of this course is simple: greatly strengthen your core JavaScript skills while preparing and updating you to write modern JavaScript.

The course includes 21 modules that go through ES6 in its entirety. An exhaustive list of topics is cataloged below, but at a glance:

Who is This For?

Almost everyone! Advanced JavaScript developers will be able to go through the course a little more quickly, but I've designed this course to be as approachable as possible.

Some of the videos feature a review of topics that are a little shaky for some such as scoping, keyword this and prototypal inheritance.

This isn't JavaScript from scratch, so if you are looking for a beginner course this probably isn't it. You should have some knowledge of functions, variables, Objects, Arrays and other fundamentals.

    Those reliant on jQuery, looking to have a better grasp on the core features of JavaScript.
    Existing JS developers who want to bridge their personal learning gaps and learn ES6 start to finish.
    PHP & WordPress Developers looking to become stronger on the client side.
    Anyone who wants to get better at JavaScript and learns well from seeing both fundamental and advanced concepts in practice.
